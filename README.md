# coding-standards

## Install this repo locally for PhpStorm

1. Clone the repo locally.
2. cd into the folder you just cloned, run `composer install`.
3. Set up the PHP CodeSniffer path to the folder you just installed the Composer packages, it'll look like this: https://cln.sh/Nse2kq
4. Go to PHP CodeSniffer Inspections, select the `ForGravity` coding standard from the dropdown, like this: https://cln.sh/ubFQf1. You can only see `ForGravity` in that dropdown if you did the previous step.
5. If you'd like to see the same validation severity reported in PhpStorm as the PHP CodeSniffer report, update the Severity to "Error" in Inspections, like this: https://cln.sh/D539s3
