## Install this repo locally for PhpStorm

1. Clone the repo locally.
2. cd into the folder you just cloned, run `composer install`.
3. Set up the PHP CodeSniffer path to the folder you just installed the Composer packages, it'll look like this: https://cln.sh/Nse2kq
4. Go to PHP CodeSniffer Inspections, select the `ForGravity` coding standard from the dropdown, like this: https://cln.sh/ubFQf1. You can only see `ForGravity` in that dropdown if you did the previous step.
